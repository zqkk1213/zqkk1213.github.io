    <p>We amend these Terms from time to time. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove
        portions of the Terms at any time by posting the amended Terms. If there is a material change, we will use
        commercially reasonable efforts to generally notify all users of any material changes to these Terms. We will
        also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms, which reflect the effective date of such Terms. Unless we state otherwise, the changes are effective
        immediately upon posting.Your continued access or use of the Services after the date of the new Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop accessing or using the Services. </p>
    <p>If any portion of the Terms is deemed to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms shall be
        unaffected and shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable.</p>

    <h2><strong>3. Requirements To Use</strong></h2>
    <p>We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion and at any time, to discontinue or modify our Services or any
        part thereof or remove or edit Content (as defined below), without prior notice either permanently or
        temporarily, at which point your right to use those Services or any part thereof will be automatically
        terminated or suspended.</p>
    <p>The transmission of information over wireless and wired networks is not inherently secure. We use many tools to
        help to protect your personal data against unauthorized access or disclosure, however, we may not guarantee that
        your personal data or private communications will always remain private when using our Services. You accept all
        responsibility for such security risks and any damage that may result therefrom. It is also your sole
        responsibility to use all reasonable and recommended measures (such as complex passwords, etc.) in order to
        secure your device from any unauthorized access.</p>
    <p>U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS: Our Services have been developed entirely at private expense and are provided
        as “Commercial Computer Software” or “restricted computer software”. Any use, duplication or disclosure by the
        U.S. Government or a U.S. Government subcontractor is subject to the restrictions set forth in subparagraph
        (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clauses in DFARS 252.227-7013 or as set forth
        in subparagraph (c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Software Restricted Rights clauses at FAR 52.227-19,
        as applicable.</p>
    <p>Any download of our Apps and use of our Services shall be in compliance with all relevant international, U.N.,
        USA or EU sales, export or import restrictions and regulations and you agree to comply with them. You represent
        and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to U.S. Government embargo, or that has
        been designated by the U.S. Government as a „terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed in any
        U.S. Government or EU sanction list of prohibited or restricted parties and you comply with relevant U.S.
        Government and EU sanctions and embargos; and (iii) you are solely responsible for compliance with all

    <h2><strong>5. Purchases In The Services</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>In-app Purchases.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When you make in-app purchases ("Virtual Items"), the payment for such purchases may be processed either by
        third parties on our behalf, or directly by the owner of the Online Store. If you download the Apps from the
        Online Store owner, when you purchase Virtual Items in our game, GameinLife is not a party to the
        transaction and your purchase will be governed by the third-party platform’s payment terms and conditions.
        Please review the platform’s terms of service for additional information. Thus, if you have any payment related
        issues (including cancellation or refund requests), then you will need to contact the respective Online Store
        owner directly.
    </p>
    <p>You understand that while you may “earn,” “buy,” or “purchase” Virtual Items in our Services, you do not legally
        “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency
        or its equivalent. Any “virtual currency” balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance
        or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your limited license.</p>
    <p>Please note that you only purchase a limited, revocable, non-transferrable license for personal use of Virtual
        Items in the Services. Virtual Items are not “sold” to you. You agree that you do not own any Virtual Items that
        you obtained through the Services, regardless of whether you earned those Virtual Items or purchased them.</p>
    <p>When making purchases in the Services, you agree that the digital content will be available to you immediately,
        and acknowledge that you will lose your rights to the 14 days cancellation period and refunds available for EU
        and EEA residents.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subscriptions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of GameinLife’s Games may offer subscription-based Services. If you purchase a subscription, then by
        clicking the
        purchase button you are requesting that we begin supplying the subscription Services immediately and you are
        entering into a recurring subscription contract with GameinLife. You are also authorizing a charge to you on
        a
        recurring subscription fee at the rate quoted at the time of purchase. By purchasing a subscription, we will
        automatically charge on a recurring basis the payment method associated with your account. For subscription
        Services purchased in a GameinLife Game played on a platform such as Apple or Google, the applicable
        platform will
        charge you for the subscription fee and the platform’s payment terms will apply. Please review the appropriate
        platform’s payment terms for additional information.</p>
    <p>Trial subscriptions are offered free of charge for a certain period of time from activation specified in the
        relevant trial offer in the Game. If you do not cancel the subscription within such trial period, the trial
        subscription will automatically convert into a paid subscription for the fees and for the subscription period
        set out in the Game at the time of the activation of the trial period. You may cancel a subscription during its
        free trial period using the subscription setting of your account.</p>
    <p>Your subscription will automatically renew each subscription period unless and until you terminate your
        subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews, otherwise payment of the
        subscription fees for the next period will be taken automatically via your chosen payment method. In case the
        subscription fee cannot be taken from your account due to absence of monetary funds, invalidity of credit card
        or for any other reason, your subscription will be automatically cancelled. </p>
    <p>Except where required by applicable law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable. </p>
