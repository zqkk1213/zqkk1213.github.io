        </li>

    <p><b>Note that we do not use such data to learn a person’s true identity or contact details, but mostly to

    <p><strong>C. Data We Collect From Other Sources</strong></p>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Third-Party Services. </strong>We may collect information about you from third-party services,
                such as advertising partners, data providers, and analytics providers. </p>

                        with
                        the Services (such as Facebook, Google or Apple). Exactly what information we receive from such
                        third-party tool will depend on your privacy settings, but it would typically include your basic
                        profile information such as your user id, username, gender, picture, e-mail, your friends
                        playing
                        the same game. We do not get access to or store your logins or passwords for any of these
                        third-party tools.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Third-party platforms.</strong>In-app purchases are typically processed by the platforms
                        (e.g. Apple App Store, Google Play, Amazon AppStore or Facebook). We do not collect or store
                        your financial data, such as your credit card number or bank account. You are requested to
                        provide payment details directly to the relevant platform. We may, however, receive limited
                        non-financial data relating to the purchase (e.g. platforms may notify us if a purchase was
                        successful). Any post-purchase processes are controlled by the platforms. We encourage you to
                        review privacy policies and terms of service of the platforms for further information before
                        making a purchase in the Services.

                        concerning the performance of our advertising campaigns (e.g. we may be provided with
                        information from which ad network and advertising campaign the install of our Service originated
                        from or data necessary to fight fraud (such as refund abuse in games or click fraud in
                        advertising).
                    </p>
